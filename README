Dico README
Copyright (C) 2008 Sergey Poznyakoff

* Introduction

This file contains brief information about configuring, testing
and running Dico. Presently this (and the source files) is the only
source of documentation about the project. Proper documentation will
be supplied as soon as the project reaches beta status.

* Overview

Dico is an implementation of DICT server (RFC 2229).  It is fully
modular: the daemon itself (dictd) provides only the server
functionality, but it knows nothing about database formats.  Actual
searches are performed by functions supplied in loadable modules.  A
single module can serve one or more databases. 

At least two modules will be added in the nearest future: a module for
handling dict.org databases, and a module for lookups in Jim Breen's
Kanjidic and Edict databases.

* What's in a name?

Dico is informal French for "Dictionary".  It is pronounced "Deekoh",
with stress on the last syllable.

* Current state

The dictd daemon is completely implemented. It provides all the
functionality required by RFC 2229, except for SASL commands.

For test purposes a database module "outline" is available.  This
module handles databases in Emacs outline format.

The dict.org module is being developed.

* Building

As usual:

 $ ./configure
 $ make

See INSTALL for the generic configure instructions.
 
* Bug reporting.
