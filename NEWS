Version 2.0.91 (GIT)

* Normalize exit codes.

The dicod server uses exit codes from sysexits.h.

* Replies to MATCH command.

The dictorg backend filters out any duplicate entries in replies
to MATCH commands. Only the first one from a sequence of such
duplicates is retained.

* New configuration statements.

** prepend-load-path

Acts much the same as module-load-path, but adds directories at front
of the default Dico module directory.

* Strategies

** All

The `all' strategy has been re-implemented as a loadable module.  To
enable this strategy in daemon, load the `stratall' module:

load-module stratall {
	command "stratall";
}

** Substr

New strategy `substr' matches a substring anywhere in the headword.
To enable this strategy, load the `substr' module:

load-module substr {
	command "substr";
}

* Dicoweb

Improved handling of databases without a descriptive name (previous
version would throw exception for such cases).

The file settings.py renamed to settings-sample.py.

The file static/opensearch.xml has been moved to the templates.  If
you are upgrading from an earlier version, you may remove it.

* Bugfixes:
** Fixed improper handling of conversion errors in levenshtein.c
(debian #582692)
** Removed the use of fixed-size buffer in dictorg.c (fixes debian
#582708)
