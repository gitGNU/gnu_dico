@node Intro
@chapter Introduction to @command{Dico}
@cindex Dico overview
@cindex two-layer model
@cindex protocol layer
@cindex database layer
@cindex RFC 2229
@cindex DICT protocol
@dfn{Dico} is an implementation of @acronym{DICT} dictionary server
(described in @acronym{RFC} 2229) and a set of accompanying utilities.
Dico's @command{dictd} server uses two-layer model.  The @dfn{protocol
layer} is responsible for correct @acronym{DICT} protocol dialog and
is served by the @command{dictd} daemon itself.  The @dfn{database
layer} is responsible for look ups in dictionary databases.  This
layer is handled by external @dfn{loadable modules}.  Thus, Dico
does not impose any specific dictionary database format.  A single
server can handle databases in various formats, provided that
appropriate modules are available.  Several database modules are
shipped with Dico:

@table @asis
@item dictorg
@cindex dictorg database format
  This module provides full support for the format designed by
the @cite{@acronym{DICT} development group} (@uref{http://dict.org}).
This is a @i{de facto} standard for @acronym{DICT} databases.  A
number of dictionary databases in this format are provided by the
@cite{FreeDict} project (@uref{http://freedict.org}).

@item guile
  This module provides an interface to Guile, the @dfn{GNU's
Ubiquitous Intelligent Language for Extensions}
(@uref{http://www.gnu.org/software/guile}) and allows to write
database modules in Scheme programming language.

@item outline
  This module handles simple databases in GNU Emacs @dfn{outline}
format.  It is designed mostly for test purposes.
@end table

  This manual describes how to configure and use the Dico dictionary
system.  It also describes the @acronym{API} for writing
@command{Dico} database modules both in @acronym{C} and in
@acronym{Scheme}.

@node Building
@chapter Building the Package
@UNREVISED
  Building @command{dico} is quite straightforward.  You run
@command{./configure}, then @command{make}, followed by @command{make
install}, and you are done.

  The actions the @command{configure} script performs can be altered
using a set of command line options and variables.  Some of these
options are generic, i.e. common for all packages using the GNU
@command{autoconf} system.  For a detailed description of these option
see the @file{INSTALL} file shipped with the sources.  Yet another
options are specific for @command{Dico}.  We will describe them in
this chapter.

@end menu

@node Default Preprocessor
@section Default Preprocessor
@cindex Default preprocessor
@cindex preprocessor, default
@vrindex DEFAULT_PREPROCESSOR     
  The runtime configuration system uses @command{m4} to preprocess
the configuration file.  This makes the configuration extremely
flexible.  We recommend to use GNU m4 as a preprocessor@footnote{@uref{http://www.gnu.org/software/m4}}.  However, any
other implementation of @command{m4} may be used.  The @command{configure}
script tries to determine full file name of the preprocessor binary
and the necessary command line options.  In case it makes a wrong
guess, you can instruct it to use a particular preprocessor by using
@env{DEFAULT_PREPROCESSOR} configuration variable.  For example, the
following @command{configure} invocation instructs it to use
@command{/usr/local/bin/gm4}:

@smallexample
$ ./configure DEFAULT_PREPROCESSOR="/usr/local/bin/gm4 -s"
@end smallexample

Note the use of @option{-s} preprocessor option.  It instructs
@command{m4} to produce line directives which help @command{dictd}
produce correct diagnostics about eventual configuration errors.
Unless your @command{m4} implementation does not have this feature, we
recommend to always use it in @env{DEFAULT_PREPROCESSOR} value.

@opindex --without-preprocessor, configuration option
Finally, if you do not wish to use preprocessor at all, you can
disable it using @option{--without-preprocessor} option to
@command{configure}.

@node Guile Support
@section Guile Support
@cindex guile, configuration
  The @dfn{GNU's Ubiquitous Intelligent Language for Extensions}, or
@dfn{Guile}@footnote{@uref{http://www.gnu.org/software/guile}.}  can
be used to write database modules for @command{dico}.  This requires
Guile version 1.8.4 or newer.  The @command{configure} script will
probe for the presence of Guile on your system and automatically
enable its use if its version number is high enough.

@opindex --without-guile, configuration option
  If you do not wish to use Guile, use @option{--without-guile} to
disable it.

@node Other Settings
@section Other Configure Settings

@vrindex LOG_FACILITY
  The @command{dictd} daemon uses @command{syslogd} for diagnostics.
The default syslog facility can be set using @env{LOG_FACILITY}
configuration variable.  Its allowed arguments are @samp{user},
@samp{daemon}, @samp{auth}, @samp{authpriv}, @samp{mail}, @samp{cron},
and @samp{local0} through @samp{local7}.  Case is not significant.  In
addition, these words can be prefixed with @samp{log_}.

  By default, the @samp{daemon} facility is used.

@node Syntax
@subsection Configuration File Syntax
@UNREVISED
  A Dico configuration consists of statements and comments.

  There are three classes of lexical tokens: keywords, values, and
separators. Blanks, tabs, newlines and comments, collectively called
@dfn{white space} are ignored excepty as they serve to separate
tokens.  Some white space is required to separate otherwise adjacent 
keywors and values.

@menu
* Comments::
* Statements::
@end menu

@node Comments
@subsubsection Comments
@cindex Comments in a configuration file
@cindex single-line comments
  @dfn{Comments} may appear anywhere where white space may appear in the
configuration file.  There are two kinds of comments:
single-line and multi-line comments.  @dfn{Single-line} comments start
with @samp{#} or @samp{//} and continue to the end of the line:

@smallexample
# This is a comment
// This too is a comment
@end smallexample

@cindex multi-line comments
  @dfn{Multi-line} or @dfn{C-style} comments start with the two
characters @samp{/*} (slash, star) and continue until the first
occurrence of @samp{*/} (star, slash).

  Multi-line comments cannot be nested.

@node Statements
@subsubsection Statements
@cindex statements, configuration file
@cindex configuration file statements
@cindex statement, simple
@cindex simple statements
  A @dfn{simple statement} consists of a keyword and value
separated by any amount of whitespace.  Simple statement is terminated
with a semicolon (@samp{;}), unless it contains a @dfn{here-document}
(see below), in which case semicolon is optional.

  Examples of simple statements:

@smallexample
timing yes;
access-log-file /var/log/access_log;
@end smallexample

  A @dfn{keyword} begins with a letter and may contain letters,
decimal digits, underscores (@samp{_}) and dashes (@samp{-}).
Examples of keywords are: @samp{group}, @samp{identity-check}.

  A @dfn{value} can be one of the following:

@table @asis
@item number
  A number is a sequence of decimal digits.

@item unquoted string
@cindex string, unquoted
  An unquoted string may contain letters, digits, and any of the
following characters: @samp{_}, @samp{-}, @samp{.}, @samp{/},
@samp{:}.

@item quoted string
@cindex quoted string
@cindex string, quoted
@cindex escape sequence
  A quoted string is any sequence of characters enclosed in
double-quotes (@samp{"}).  A backslash appearing within a quoted
string introduces an @dfn{escape sequence}, which is replaced
with a single character according to the following rules:

@float Table, backslash-interpretation
@caption{Backslash escapes}
@multitable @columnfractions 0.30 .5
@item Sequence @tab Replaced with
@item \a @tab Audible bell character (@acronym{ASCII} 7)
@item \b @tab Backspace character (@acronym{ASCII} 8)
@item \f @tab Form-feed character (@acronym{ASCII} 12)
@item \n @tab Newline character (@acronym{ASCII} 10)
@item \r @tab Carriage return character (@acronym{ASCII} 13)
@item \t @tab Horizontal tabulation character (@acronym{ASCII} 9)
@item \\ @tab A single backslash (@samp{\})
@item \" @tab A double-quote.
@end multitable
@end float

  In addition, the sequence @samp{\@var{newline}} is removed from
the string.  This allows to split long strings over several
physical lines, e.g.:

@smallexample
@group
"a long string may be\
 split over several lines"
@end group
@end smallexample

  If the character following a backslash is not one of those specified
above, the backslash is ignored and a warning is issued.

  Two or more adjacent quoted strings are concatenated, which gives
another way to split long strings over several lines to improve
readability.  The following fragment produces the same result as the
example above:

@smallexample
@group
"a long string may be"
" split over several lines"
@end group
@end smallexample

@item Here-document
@cindex here-document
  @dfn{Here-document} is a special construct that allows to introduce
strings of text containing embedded newlines.  

  The @code{<<@var{word}} construct instructs the parser to read all
the following lines up to the line containing only @var{word}, with
possible trailing blanks.  Any lines thus read are concatenated
together into a single string.  For example:

@smallexample
@group
<<EOT
A multiline
string
EOT
@end group
@end smallexample

  Body of a here-document is interpreted the same way as
double-quoted string, unless @var{word} is preceded by a backslash
(e.g. @samp{<<\EOT}) or enclosed in double-quotes, in which case
the text is read as is, without interpretation of escape sequences.

  If @var{word} is prefixed with @code{-} (a dash), then all leading
tab characters are stripped from input lines and the line containing
@var{word}.  Furthermore, if @code{-} is followed by a single space,
all leading whitespace is stripped from them.  This allows to indent
here-documents in a natural fashion.  For example:

@smallexample
@group
<<- TEXT
    All leading whitespace will be
    ignored when reading these lines.
TEXT
@end group
@end smallexample

  As a ``syntactical sugar'', statements containing here-documents are
not required to end with a semicolon.  If, however, a semicolon is
used, it may not appear on the same line with the terminating
@var{word} delimiter, e.g.:

@smallexample
help-text <<-EOT
        A sample help text.
EOT
;
@end smallexample

@item list
@cindex list
  A @dfn{list} is a comma-separated list of values.  Lists are
delimited by parentheses.  The following example shows a statement
whose value is a list of strings:

@smallexample
capability (mime,auth);
@end smallexample

  In any case where a list is appropriate, a single value is allowed
without being a member of a list: it is equivalent to a list with a
single member.  This means that, e.g. @samp{capability mime;} is
equivalent to @samp{capability (mime);}.

@end table

@cindex statement, block
@cindex block statement
  A @dfn{block statement} introduces a logical group of another
statements.  It consists of a keyword, followed by an optional value,
and a sequence of statements enclosed in curly braces, as shown in
the example below:

@smallexample
@group
handler outline @{
        type loadable;
        command "outline";
@}
@end group
@end smallexample

  The closing curly brace may be followed by a semicolon, although
this is not required.

@node Server Settings
@subsection Control Server Behavior
@UNREVISED
  Server settings control how @command{dictd} is executed on the
server machine.

@anchor{user statement}
@deffn {Configuration} user @var{string}
Run with the privileges of this user.  @command{Dictd} does not
require root privileges, so it is recommended to always use this
statement when running @command{dictd} in daemon mode.
@FIXME-xref{operation modes}. 

Example:
@smallexample
user nobody;
@end smallexample
@end deffn

@anchor{group statement}
@deffn {Configuration} group @var{list}
If @code{user} is given, @command{dictd} will drop all supplementary
groups and switch to the principal group of that user.  Sometimes,
however, it may be necessary to retain one or more supplementary
groups.  For example, this might be necessary to access dictionary
databases.  The @code{group} statement retains the supplementary
groups listed in @var{list}, e.g.:

@smallexample
user nobody
group (man, dict)
@end smallexample

This statement is ignored if @code{user} statement is not present or
if @command{dictd} is running in inetd mode. @FIXME-xref{operation modes}.
@end deffn

@deffn {Configuration} mode @var{enum}
Sets server operation mode. The argument is one of:

@table @asis
@item daemon
Run in daemon mode.

@item inetd
Run in inetd mode.
@end table

@FIXME-xref{operation modes}.
This statement is overridden by the @option{--inetd} command line
option. @FIXME-xref{--inetd}.
@end deffn

@deffn {Configuration} listen @var{list};
Specify @acronym{IP} addresses and ports to listen on in daemon mode.
By default, @command{dictd} will listen on port 2628 on all existing
interfaces.  Use @code{listen} statement to abridge the list of
interfaces to listen on, or to change the port number. 

Elements of @var{list} can have the following form:

@table @asis
@item @var{host}:@var{port}
  Specifies an @acronym{IP}v4 socket to listen on.  The @var{host}
part is either a host name or an @acronym{IP} in ``dotted-quad''
form.  The @var{port} part is either a numeric port number or a
symbolic service name which is found in @file{/etc/services} file.

  Either of the two parts may be omitted.  If @var{host} is omitted,
it defaults to @samp{0.0.0.0}, which means ``listen on all
interfaces''.  If @var{port} is omitted, it defaults to 2628.  In this
case the colon may be omitted, too.

  Examples:
  
@smallexample
listen localhost:2628;
listen 127.0.0.1;
listen :2628;
@end smallexample

@item @var{filename}
  Specifies the name of a @acronym{UNIX} socket to listen on.
@end table

  The following statement instructs @command{dictd} to listen on
the address @samp{10.10.10.1}, port 2628 and on the @acronym{UNIX}
socket @file{/var/run/dict}:

@smallexample
listen (10.10.10.1, /var/run/dict);
@end smallexample

@end deffn

@deffn {Configuration} pidfile @var{string}
Store @acronym{PID} of the master process in this file.
Default is @file{@var{localstatedir}/run/dictd.pid}. 
Notice that the privileges of this default directory are
may be insufficient for @command{dictd} to write there after switching
to users privileges (@pxref{user statement}).  One solution to this is
to create a subdirectory with the same owner as given by @code{user}
statement and to point the @acronym{PID} file there:

@smallexample
pidfile /var/run/dict/dictd.pid;
@end smallexample

Another solution is to make @acronym{PID} directory group-writable and
to add the owner group to the @code{group} statement (@pxref{group
statement}).

@FIXME{I am not sure this is quite right.  Should `make install'
create the $localstate/run/dict directory?  But then, make doesn't
know what user to set as its owner...}
@end deffn

@deffn {Configuration} max-children @var{number}
Sets maximum number of sub-processes that can run simultaneously.
This is equivalent to the number of clients that can simultaneously
use the server.  The default is 64 sub-processes.
@end deffn

@deffn {Configuration} inactivity-timeout @var{number}
Set inactivity timeout to the @var{number} of seconds.  The server
will disconnect automatically if remote client did not send any
command within this number of seconds.  Setting timeout to 0 disables
inactivity timeout (the default).

Using this statement along with @code{max-children} allows to control
the server load.
@end deffn

@deffn {Configuration} shutdown-timeout @var{number}
When the master server is shutting down, wait this number of seconds for all
children to terminate.  Default is 5 seconds.
@end deffn

@deffn {Configuration} identity-check @var{boolean}
Enable identification check using @acronym{AUTH} protocol
(@acronym{RFC} 1413).  The received user name or @acronym{UID} can
be shown in access log using @code{%l} format (@pxref{Access Log}).
@end deffn

@deffn {Configuration} ident-keyfile @var{string}
Use encryption keys from the named file to decrypt @acronym{AUTH}
replies encrypted using @acronym{DES}.
