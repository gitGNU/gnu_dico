* Overview

The module/template directory contains template files for creating new
Dicod modules.  It is used by the bootstrap tool in the Dico topmost
source directory.

See "bootstrap --help", for a detailed information about the tool and
its operation modes.

* FILE LIST

  This section lists the files that are to be copied from the
  module/template directory to the newly created module
  directory.  They also form the expansion of the <TEMPLATE>
  variable in modules/stub.am.

  On each line, a whitespace character (space or tab) starts a
  comment that spans to the physical end of line.  Empty lines
  are ignored.  Any continuous sequence of one or more
  non-whitespace characters starting in column 1 forms a file
  name.
